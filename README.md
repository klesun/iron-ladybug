An adventure/puzzle Unity game
=======================
We have moving platforms and a charismatic heroine!

### Setup

After cloning this repo, open it with Unity Editor. 

You will also need the unversioned files that are fetched with dropbox. 
Link to `safronevev@gmail.com` dropbox and specify `riddle-needle/Assets/Resources/` as Dropbox folder location 
(it will still create folder named "Dropbox" inside - that's ok).
